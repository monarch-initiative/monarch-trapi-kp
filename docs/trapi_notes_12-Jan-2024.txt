Richard B - Question 1:
 The Subject "provided_by": "phenio_nodes" is found at the top level of the raw SemSimian response data. This suggests that infores:phenio is a kind of knowledge source. As it happens, though, the original knowledge source may be infores:hpo-annotations. Of course, the SemSimian algorithm somehow crops up as a generative KP in the middle (infores:semsimian-kp)

 Kevin Schaper
That's not edge provenance though, that's my somewhat awkward need to use "provided_by" in new monarch infrastructure the same way it was used in old monarch infrastructure, even though translator doesn't want it to be part of the biolink model (probably I should push for something like "processed_by" or something)

Matthew Brush
The primary source for most edges in the knowledge graph be "semsimian", in that SemSimian is the authority "asserting" the similarity edge, with the exception of edges from HPOA reporting "DiseaseX-has_phenotype-.PhenotypeY" (for these, HPOA is the primary ks).

For the other knowledge source attributions in edges, a typical 'sources' attribution is something like:

    "sources": [
      {
        "resource_id": "infores:semsimian-kp",
       	"resource_role": "primary_knowledge_source",
       	"source_record_urls": null,
       	"upstream_resource_ids": ["infores:hpo-annotations", "infores:upheno"]
       },
      {
        "resource_id": "infores:hpo-annotations",
       	"resource_role": "supporting_data_source",
       	"source_record_urls": null,
       	"upstream_resource_ids": []
       },
      {
        "resource_id": "infores:upheno",
       	"resource_role": "supporting_data_source",
       	"source_record_urls": null,
       	"upstream_resource_ids": []
       }
     ]

but the PLATER code from which the Monarch TRAPI KP code is derived, may not properly deal with 'supporting_data_source'  in the upstream_resource_ids. This needs to be reviewed.

========================================================================================

Richard B - Question 2: what's the 'ex:' CURIE prefix?

Sierra Moxon:
I think that is maybe "ex" for "example" :slightly_smiling_face:

Matthew Brush:
yes, that is correct . . . I just use it for edge ids.  not sure how these are actually crafted by the different KPs.

========================================================================================

Richard B - Question 3: SemSimian 'similarity' has both 'subject_termset' and 'object_termset". It previously seemed to me that the QGraph Node input HPO terms map onto the 'object_termset' only... But not sure if this was just an accidental constraint of my original sample input (using HPO terms that Kevin used...)

Sierra Moxon:
I think its like collection of phenoterms in query results in a set of matching phenotype terms for the disease and a set of matching phenotype terms for the search collection (because its infrequent that the search terms themselves are the ones that match the disease, instead some higher level in the ontology term in the ontology for each of the terms in the query)

Matthew Brush:
yes, that is my understanding.

========================================================================================

Richard B - Question 4: I understand the edge scoring, but where is the top level SemSimian score value stored in the TRAPI output?  Is there a (UUID) meta-edge that captures it?

Sierra Moxon:
I think the top level score is depicted in line 99
